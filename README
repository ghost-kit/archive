This ParaView reader plugin demonstrates how to write a multi-port
reader.  The example stores a sturctured grid as output[0] and a
vtkTable storing vtkStringArray's as output[1].

This plugin was implemented using
ParaView-src/VTK/Parallel/vtkWindBladeReader.* as a reference point.
Tested/validated on ParaView-3.12.0.
